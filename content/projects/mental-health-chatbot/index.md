[cite_start]Developed a comprehensive NLP pipeline for a mental health chatbot, covering tokenization, vectorization, and model training[cite: 22, 24].

**Key Contributions:**
* [cite_start]Achieved 77% intent-recognition accuracy, improving response selection with additional rule-based matching[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]Integrated LLM-like conversational design and model evaluation for response precision[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]Utilized PyTorch and spaCy on Google Colab for efficient model training and deployment[cite: 22, 24].
