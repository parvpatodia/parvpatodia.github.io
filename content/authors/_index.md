Hey, I'm Parv! I like to build things that work. Currently a master's student in AI at Northeastern Silicon Valley, coming from a mechanical engineering background where I learned to think systematically about problems. 

In software and AI, I love the immediate feedback loop—you think it, code it, run it, and ship it. I've worked on everything from mental health chatbots and autonomous vehicle perception systems to building platforms that process data and extract insights. I’m driven by projects where a model's improvement directly translates to better answers for real people.
