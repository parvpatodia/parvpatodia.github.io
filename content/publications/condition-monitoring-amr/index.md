abstract: "This research focuses on building a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for torque estimation in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). By utilizing forward propagation with ReLU activation, the system enables real-time condition monitoring. The project involved developing a real-time telemetry acquisition system in MATLAB and a GUI for streaming signals and historical logs to enable faster fault detection."

summary: "Developed a PINN for torque estimation in a PMSM and a real-time telemetry acquisition system for an Automated Mobile Robot."

**Key Research Highlights:**
*Built a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for torque estimation in a PMSM, using forward propagation with ReLU activation[cite: 27].
*Developed a real-time telemetry acquisition system in MATLAB (RS-485), parsing and visualizing multi-frame data streams[cite: 28].
*Built a GUI to display streaming signals and store historical logs, enabling faster fault detection and issue triage[cite: 29].
