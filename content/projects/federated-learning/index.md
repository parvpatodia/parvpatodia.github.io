[cite_start]Built a federated learning framework designed for distributed model training on non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) datasets with differential noise[cite: 18, 20].

**Key Contributions:**
* [cite_start]Evaluated convergence efficiency and accuracy trade-offs between centralized and decentralized systems[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]Implemented differential noise mechanisms to enhance privacy during training[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]Managed codebase and versioning using Git to ensure reproducible machine learning experiments[cite: 18].
